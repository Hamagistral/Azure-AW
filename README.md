## 🔬 Project Overview 

This an end-to-end data engineering project on the Azure cloud. Where I did data ingestion from a on-premise SQL Server to Azure Data Lake using Data Factory to transformation using Databricks and Spark, loading to Synapse, and reporting using PowerBI. Also, I used Azure Active Directory (AAD) and Azure Key Vault for the data monitoring and governance purpose. 

### 💾 Dataset

**AdventureWorks** is a database provided by Microsoft for free on online platforms. It is a product sample database originally published by Microsoft to demonstrate the supposed design of a SQL server database using SQL server 2008. Here are some key points to know about AdventureWorks:

- AdventureWorks database supports a manufacturing MNC named Adventure Works Cycles.
- It is a sample Online Transaction Processing (or OLTP) database, which is a type of data processing where multiple transactions occur concurrently. These are shipped by Microsoft with all of their SQL server products.

> For this project I used the **Lightweight (LT) data**: a lightweight and pared down version of the OLTP sample. [Download here](https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/releases/download/adventureworks/AdventureWorksLT2022.bak)

### 🎯 Project Goals

- Establish a connection between on-premise SQL server and Azure cloud.
- Ingest tables into the Azure Data Lake.
- Apply data cleaning and transformation using Azure Databricks.
- Utilize Azure Synapse Analytics for loading clean data.
- Create interactive data visualizations and reports with Microsoft Power BI.
- Implement Azure Active Directory (AAD) and Azure Key Vault for monitoring and governance.

## 🕵️ Key Insights

- 💸 **Total Revenue by Product Category**
  - *Touring Bikes* is the top 1 category generating revenue with 32% followed by *Road Bikes* with 26% and *Mountain Bikes* with 24%.
 
- 🌍 **Sales by Country**
  - **N°1:** The United Kingdom (UK) have the most total sales with 278 and $572,000 of total revenue.
  - **N°2:** The United States of America (USA) is second with total sales with 264 and $383,810 of total revenue.

- 🚻 **Revenue by Gender**
  - 81% of the revenue is generated by Male customers
  - 19% of the revenue is generated by Female customers  

> This can be explained by males have more interest in doing outdoor activites with the different categories of Bikes than females.

<a name="data-transformation"></a>
### ⚙️ Data Transformation
- Mounted Azure Blob Storage to Databricks to retrieve raw data from the Data Lake.
- Used Spark Cluster in Azure Databricks to clean and refine the raw data.
- Saved the cleaned data in a Delta format; optimized for further analysis.

<a name="data-loading"></a>
### 📥 Data Loading
- Used Azure Synapse Analytics to load the refined data efficiently.
- Created SQL database and connected it to the data lake.
